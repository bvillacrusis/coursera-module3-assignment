This tidy data set (tidy_data_set) is a cleaned version of the data collected 
from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. It shows the
means of each variable for each activity for each user. Teh means are computed ONLY
for variables associated to MEAN and STANDARD DEVIATION values.

The general purpose of the complete data sets is to develop the most advanced algorithms
to attract new users of smart phones. These data sets will be used for wearable computing.

Below is the link to the site where the complete data sets was obtained:

Data sets can be downloaded in the following URL with a complete description (read READ ME file):

The script, run_analysis.R, is used to merge and clean those data sets to come up with a tidy data set.
The general flow of the code to create the tidy data set is described below:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
For more details on how the script works, read the READ.md files.
   
 The content of the tidy_data_set.txt file shows the mean of each variable per user and per activity.
 The column label is for each activity and variable, while the row is for the user.
 
 For example, the first value (row 2 and column 1) -0.9280564692 is the mean for variable 3D.Signal.Body.Accelerator.StandardDev_X
 and activity LAYING (i.e. the column label is "LAYING.3D.Signal.Body.Accelerator.StandardDev_X") for user 1.
 
 You may use read.table to read the tidy data set. This will give you a three-dimensional matrix
 where first index is for USER, 2nd index for Activity Label and the 3rd index for the mean of the variables.

This tidy data set composed of 30 rows (excluding the header) and 396 columns (6 activities and 66 variables).
